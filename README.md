# PokemonCli

PokemonCli is a command line based Pokemon Red/Blue clone built using Ruby, ActiveRecord, and PokeApi.
At the moment you can create a new Trainer, choose a starter Pokemon, and catch all 151 first generation
Pokemon throughout the "Kanto" region.

## Playing The Game

After creating a new Trainer and selecting a starter Pokemon, you will start in "Pallet Town".
From there where you go and what you do is on you to decide! The game in it's current state is unrestrictive,
so from the start you can find and catch any Pokemon including all the legendary Pokemon that reside in Kanto.
